      <p>
        I was an automotive technician for a few years but concluded it was not
        where I wanted to be. I found a passion for computing and programming
        and began my education in computer science. I now have a solid
        foundation in web development using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and
        technologies such as MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js (MERN
        Stack). I am now looking to begin my career in web development.
